# C++

C++ is a programming language known for having fast performance and giving you a lot of control over the computer. This makes it highly valued in fields like Geomatics for these reasons:

- **Quick to run:** In tasks where speed and resource management are crucial, C++ is a great choice. It offers you a lot of control, and it was built for speed.
- **Many libraries:** Although C++ might not have as many libraries as Python, it still has a big set of libraries specifically made for various tasks, including geospatial data processing. These libraries provide pre-written code, saving time and effort in developing your programs.
- **Open source, free, very popular:** C++ is widely used in various industries, including Geomatics but also software development, game development and more. Because it's widely used, there are a lot of resources, documentation, and community support available for learners and professionals.

As you can see, there seem to be many similarities with [the reasons Python is used for Geomatics](../python). One big difference already stands out. Python is **quick to write** and C++ is **quick to run**. The opposite is also true, Python is **slow(er) to run** and C++ is **slow(er) to write**.
