# Linux

For a few courses you'll have to use the operating system Linux :simple-linux:

You can install Linux on your Windows computers with basically 2 different ways:

1. with [WSL](./wsl.md) (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
2. by running it [virtually with VirtualBox](./virtualbox.md)

And you'll have to access some Linux servers [using ssh](./ssh.md).

One big difference is the [filesystem](../computer/filesystem.md), make sure you familiarise yourself with it.
