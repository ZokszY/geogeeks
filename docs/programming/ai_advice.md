# Advice on using AI (ChatGPT & Copilot)

AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are by now widely known and used. They have proven that in certain aspects an AI can be quite good at programming. You might be wondering if and how you should be using these tools for your Geomatics studies.

!!! warning "Plagiarism & Fraud"
    This page is written by fellow students. Rules around the use of AI can change at any time, including if the use of these tools for your assignment is considered plagiarism or fraud. On this page we try to give a perspective from the educational/learning point of view.

### Downsides of using AI for programming
It might be very tempting to make ChatGPT or Copilot write code for your assignments by giving it a description of what you want the code to do. Here is our point of view on why this might not be a good idea:

- **If you are learning to code, using AI can work against you.** Usually, programmers learn the most by writing code and solving issues. By letting an AI write code for you, you don't build a sense of coding concepts and problem-solving. Also, an AI might suggest code that uses concepts or features that you are not yet familiar with. You might not be able to check if the code actually does what you want it to do. 
- **AI models make mistakes or don't understand what you are expecting it to do.** We've personally seen many times both ChatGPT and Copilot suggest completely wrong solutions. We highly discourage using code from an AI without reading it thoroughly first.
- **Using AI might lead to hasty and not-well-thought-out code.** While an AI might be good at making a single piece of code, it has no sense of the scope of your whole project or what you want to do. Using an AI makes you more likely to just accept its solution instead of taking the time to think if this is actually the best way to do it for your project.

### Advantages of using AI for programming
It's not without reason that these tools have become so popular. Let's look at some advantages for using them.

- **Help with debugging.** If you are running into errors that you can't find the solution for, or something keeps going wrong and you don't know why. An AI can give an extra opinion. It will definitely not always be right or find the cause, but it can offer valuable help.
- **If you are looking for extra help while learning, AI can be very helpful.** AI models, especially interactive language models like ChatGPT, can be very useful for asking questions about coding concepts you want to learn more about. If you don't understand a certain part of a tutorial you are following, you can ask ChatGPT to explain it in a different way. You can also ask ChatGPT to give feedback on code you've written. 
- **If you're working with a library with difficult usage/documentation, it can help you.** Sometimes, you're looking how to do a very specific thing but don't know how it's done in the library you are using. When you already know what you want to do, but you can't find how to do it from the documentation, using either sites like StackOverflow or asking an AI can help you solve the problem while still understanding why that solved the problem.
- **If you already are quite experienced with coding, using an AI for repetitive tasks can speed you up.** At a certain moment, you've written the code to open a json file many times. AI tools can take over these repetitive tasks for you. Be careful though, AIs can still make mistakes or suggest something that you were not expecting. Always check the suggested code.
- **If you have to read code in a language you don't know, AI can be very useful.** If you are researching a specific paper, and the code supplied in that paper is in a programming language you don't know. No-one is expecting you to learn a new language to read that paper, you can ask an AI for some help understanding the code.

These tools are here to help programmers, not to replace programmers. Our advice is to use them to improve your programming skills, but not to become too dependent on them.
