# Choosing a programming language

In the MSc Geomatics you will focus on the following two languages:

- :simple-python: [Python](../../python) (Mainly in GEO1000, GEO1015 and GEO5017, also used in GEO1001 and GEO1003)
- :simple-cplusplus: [C++](../../cpp) (GEO1004, GEO1016)

Besides these two languages, you'll be introduced to:

- :simple-html5: HTML + :simple-css3: CSS (GEO1007)
- :simple-javascript: JavaScript (GEO1007)

    **Should I choose *yes*?**
    Choose *yes* if your project is intended to be a web-based application or service. This includes anything that runs primarily in a web browser, like interactive websites, web applications, online tools, or platforms. These projects often require specific languages and technologies tailored for web development, focusing on aspects like user interface, interactivity, web standards, and compatibility with various browsers.

    **Should I choose *no*?**
    Select *no* your project involves software that runs locally on a computer or a server, not relying on a web browser. This category includes desktop applications, server-side software, scripts for data analysis, automation tools, mobile apps, and games. These projects often demand languages and frameworks that are optimized for performance, hardware integration, operating system compatibility, or specific computational tasks.
